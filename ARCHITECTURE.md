# Architecture

This document describes the high-level architecture of Relay, a workflow engine that pairs Cloudflare Workflows with Cloudflare Durable Objects to let developers define interactive, multi-step workflows in backend code and have them rendered automatically in a React frontend. If you want to familiarize yourself with the codebase, this is a good place to start.

## Bird's Eye View

A workflow author writes a handler using a small SDK (`createWorkflow`). The SDK provides primitives — `input`, `output`, `loading`, `confirm` — that each become a durable step in a Cloudflare Workflow. Each step sends a JSON message to a per-run Durable Object, which persists the message and broadcasts it over an NDJSON stream. A React SPA connects to that stream and renders structured UI (forms, spinners, confirmation dialogs, rich content) without any per-workflow frontend code.

There is also a synchronous call-response API for agents (MCP, CLI) that blocks until the next interaction point, so non-browser clients can drive workflows too.

## Codemap

The repo is a pnpm monorepo with two packages and one example app.

### `packages/sdk`

The core SDK. Everything needed to build a Relay-powered Cloudflare Worker.

Three entry points:

- **`relay-sdk`** — Server-side. `createWorkflow`, `RelayWorkflow`, `RelayDurableObject`, `RelayMcpAgent`, `httpHandler`, registry functions.
- **`relay-sdk/client`** — Browser-safe. Message types, schemas, `parseStreamMessage`. No `cloudflare:workers` dependency.
- **`relay-sdk/mcp`** — Node.js. `createRelayMcpServer` factory for stdio-based MCP servers.

Internally split into two directories:

- **`src/isomorphic/`** — Shared types and logic with no Cloudflare runtime dependency. Message schemas (`messages.ts`), input field types (`input.ts`), output block types (`output.ts`), registry types, MCP text formatting.
- **`src/sdk/`** — Cloudflare-specific implementation. The key files:
  - `cf-workflow.ts` — `RelayWorkflow` class (`WorkflowEntrypoint`) and `createWorkflow()` factory
  - `cf-durable-object.ts` — `RelayDurableObject`, stores and streams messages per run
  - `cf-http.ts` — HTTP request handler with all routes
  - `cf-mcp-agent.ts` — `RelayMcpAgent`, Cloudflare-native MCP server (Durable Object)
  - `workflow-api.ts` — Core execution functions shared between the HTTP handler and MCP agent
  - `registry.ts` — Global workflow registry (`Map`), populated by `createWorkflow()`

### `packages/web`

React SPA (React 19, React Router v7, Tailwind v4). Independently deployable. Connects to a Relay worker via a configurable API URL.

The core hook is `useWorkflowStream` — it manages the full lifecycle of connecting to a run's NDJSON stream, parsing messages with Zod, and exposing state to the UI. Message rendering is driven by the `StreamMessage` discriminated union; the UI never needs to know what workflow it's displaying.

### `apps/examples`

Example Cloudflare Worker demonstrating the deployment shape: imports `relay-sdk`, defines workflows, deploys independently. Contains several example workflows covering simple to complex cases.

### `mcp/`

Thin MCP server entrypoint that delegates to `relay-sdk/mcp`. Used for running a local MCP server over stdio.

### `tests/e2e/`

Playwright end-to-end tests.

## Ground Rules

- **`isomorphic/` has no Cloudflare runtime imports.** Everything in `src/isomorphic/` must be safe to import from both the Worker and the browser. The `relay-sdk/client` entry point re-exports only from this directory.
- **Workflows self-register.** `createWorkflow()` pushes into a global `Map`. There is no manual wiring step — importing a workflow file is sufficient.
- **Every SDK primitive is a `step.do()` call.** `output`, `input`, `loading`, and `confirm` all go through Cloudflare's `step.do()`, making them replay-safe and durable.
- **The frontend is workflow-agnostic.** The React app renders any workflow purely from the `StreamMessage` stream. There is no per-workflow UI code.
- **The Durable Object is the source of truth.** All messages are persisted in the DO. The stream replays full history on reconnect, so the client can recover from disconnects or page reloads.

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Message protocol:** The `StreamMessage` Zod-validated discriminated union (on `type`) is the contract between SDK, DO, HTTP layer, and frontend. All message types are defined once in `isomorphic/messages.ts`.

**Input schema / type inference:** `InputSchema` field definitions (`text`, `number`, `checkbox`, `select`) flow from workflow definition through the stream protocol to the frontend form renderer. TypeScript inference maps field types to result types (`text` -> `string`, `checkbox` -> `boolean`, etc.).

**Dual API surface:** Both the interactive API (browser: stream + events) and the call-response API (agents: blocking POST) share the same core execution functions in `workflow-api.ts`, avoiding divergence.

## SDK Primitives

The handler context (`RelayContext`) passed to every workflow:

| Property                                     | Signature                                       | What it does                                            |

## HTTP API

### Interactive API (browser clients)

| Method | Path                            | Action                                                  |
| ------ | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`  | `/workflows`                    | Returns workflow metadata list from registry            |
| `POST` | `/workflows`                    | Creates a new workflow instance, returns `{ id, name }` |
| `GET`  | `/workflows/:id/stream`         | Proxies to the DO's NDJSON stream                       |
| `POST` | `/workflows/:id/event/:name`    | Submits user response (input value or confirm decision) |
| `GET`  | `/workflows/:slug/loader/:name` | Runs a loader fetch for table pagination/search         |

## Loaders And Presenters

Loaders let a workflow emit a table without persisting all rows into the NDJSON
stream. Instead, `output.table({ source, ... })` streams only table metadata and
the browser fetches pages on demand from `GET /workflows/:slug/loader/:name`.

The loader itself is still registered globally with the workflow definition, but
the handler receives a serializable `LoaderRef` rather than a direct callback.
That ref captures any bound params from the workflow run and is later turned into
a server-built fetch path by `RelayWorkflow`.

Presenters are the reusable, named version of table display logic. They hold
column definitions, including `renderCell` callbacks, on the server side. When a
loader-backed table uses a presenter, the streamed block only includes:

- a server-built `loader.path` for later fetches
- serialized column metadata for the browser renderer

This keeps render callbacks out of the stream while still letting the HTTP layer
re-apply them to each fetched row before returning JSON to the frontend.

### Call-response API (agents)

| Method | Path                   | Action                                                  |
| ------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `POST` | `/api/run`             | Starts a workflow, blocks until first interaction point |
| `POST` | `/api/run/:id/respond` | Submits a response, blocks until next interaction point |

Both return a `CallResponseResult`:

```ts
{
  run_id: string;
  status: "awaiting_input" | "awaiting_confirm" | "complete";
  messages: StreamMessage[];      // all messages since last interaction
  interaction: InputRequestMessage | ConfirmRequestMessage | null;
}
```

## How `input()` suspends and resumes

1. `step.do(requestEvent)` → sends `input_request` message to DO stream
2. `step.waitForEvent(eventName)` → suspends the Workflow
3. Client submits form → `POST /workflows/:id/event/:name` → sends `input_received` to DO + calls `instance.sendEvent()` to resume
4. Workflow continues with the submitted payload
